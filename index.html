			##the <meta> element is used alot throughout. I'm not sure exactly why this is used but figure it has something to do with meta data. "End if" and <noscript> are used as well but unsure how these function overall. I actually don't see many elements that I immediately recognize and know how to use other than <href>. Overall, the site is arranged well like a typical blog post. Once I understand how to use CSS, JavaScript, etc. I think it'll make alot more sense to me.
